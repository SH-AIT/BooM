**Our vision:** Build open-source AI basic software de facto standards based on openEuler to promote the prosperity of the enterprise intelligent application ecosystem.

**When big models meet industry implementation, why do we need a full-stack solution?** 

DeepSeek innovation lowers the threshold for implementing large models. AI enters the "Jervins Paradox" moment. Requirements increase significantly, multi-modal interaction breaks through hardware restrictions, and low computing power requirements reconstruct deployment logic, marking the transition from the "technical verification period" to the "scale implementation period". However, the core contradictions in industry practice gradually emerged:

**Industry pain points** 

**Difficult adaptation:** The requirements for inference delay, computing cost, and multi-modal support vary greatly in different industries (such as finance, manufacturing, and healthcare). A single model or tool chain cannot cover diversified requirements.

**High cost:**  From model training to deployment, collaboration between (PyTorch/TensorFlow/MindSpore), hardware (CPU/GPU/NPU), and storage (relational database/vector database) is required. Hardware resource utilization is low and O&M complexity increases exponentially.

**Ecosystem fragmentation:**  Tool chains of hardware vendors (such as Huawei and NVIDIA), framework vendors (such as  Meta, and Google) are incompatible with each other. Patchwork deployment leads to long development cycles and inefficient iterations. Technical challenges

**Inference efficiency bottleneck:** The parameter scale of large models exceeds trillions. Traditional inference engines do not support dynamic graph calculation, sparse activation, and hybrid precision, causing a serious waste of computing power.

**Inefficient resource collaboration:**  Heterogeneous computing power scheduling of CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs depends on manual experience. Memory and video memory fragmentation leads to idle resources.

To solve the preceding problems, we collaborate with the open source community to accelerate the maturity of the open source inference solution Intelligence BooM.
